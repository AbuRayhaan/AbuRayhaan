  <h1> Hi there 👋 I'm Hammed ✨</h1>
</div> 

✨ I'm a passionate Software Developer from Nigeria, Africa.

🎓 I graduated from the University of Port Harcourt with a degree in 🏗 B.Sc. Computer Science.

⚡ I started my coding journey in November 2021. Currently, I am studying as a remote student
at Microverse.

👨‍💻 I spend most of my time learning to code by watching tutorials and reading materials about HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript. 

💻 My most used line of code is git commit -m "Initial project setup"😄

👯 I'm a team player, effective collaborator and willing to contribute to open source projects, 
collaborate and help other students in Microverse.
